ViTs (Vision Transformers): Image classification without CNNs.

üîπ Model Evaluation Metrics
1Ô∏è‚É£ Regression Metrics
R¬≤ Score: Measures variance explained by the model.
MSE & RMSE: Penalizes large errors, RMSE is more interpretable.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures absolute differences between predictions and actual values.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Classification Metrics
Accuracy: Overall correctness.
Precision & Recall: Trade-off between false positives & false negatives.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision & recall.
AUC-ROC Curve: Evaluates classification performance at different thresholds.

üîπ Model Optimization & Debugging
1Ô∏è‚É£ Bias-Variance Tradeoff
High Bias: Model too simple, underfits.
High Variance: Model too complex, overfits.
Solution: More data, regularization, feature selection.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Regularization Techniques
L1 (Lasso): Shrinks coefficients, some become zero (feature selection).
L2 (Ridge): Shrinks all coefficients, prevents overfitting.
Dropout: Randomly drops neurons to prevent overfitting.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid Search: Exhaustive search over hyperparameter space.
Random Search: Random sampling of hyperparameters.
Bayesian Optimization: Uses prior results to select next best set of hyperparameters.

üîπ Explainability & Interpretability
LIME: Local surrogate models for individual predictions.
SHAP: Assigns feature importance scores for each prediction.
Counterfactual Explanations: Suggests changes in input features to alter model outcomes.
