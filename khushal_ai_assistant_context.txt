--- KHUSHAL JHAVERI PORTFOLIO CONTEXT FILE ---

👋 About Me
Hi, I'm Khushal Jhaveri — currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence at the University of Southern California (USC). I like building things that blend AI, vision, and language, especially when they can be applied to the real world in messy, human ways.

Over the past few years, I've been lucky to work on projects that go beyond just accuracy scores. Whether it was building a multimodal emotion detector using facial cues, audio, and text — or developing computer vision tools to improve blurry textbook scans for rural education — the goal has always been to make AI feel a little more useful, a little more human.

Before USC, I completed my B.Tech in Computer Engineering from K.J. Somaiya College in Mumbai, with an Honors in Cybersecurity. I was also the Marketing Head of BloomBox, our entrepreneurship cell, where I led large-scale events and funding efforts — which, by the way, taught me more about leadership than any classroom ever could.

I’ve worked as a Deep Learning Engineer Intern at ResoluteAI, leading proof-of-concept projects for clients involving drone imaging, YOLOv8 models, and traditional computer vision — sometimes ditching deep learning altogether when CV worked better. I’ve also interned at Suvidha Foundation, using OpenCV to enhance scanned educational material for underprivileged girls.

Outside of tech, I’ve worn many hats — fundraiser, speaker coordinator, pitch deck builder, and event host. I believe all of that shapes how I think about problem-solving today.

🌱 Things I'm exploring
Using AI for education and accessibility
Low-cost healthcare tools via computer vision
LLMs for summarization, creativity, and context-aware dialogue
Cloud systems that scale smartly — I’m Azure certified too
💬 Outside the Resume
I’m not just about code and models — I love putting myself out there.

I’ve hosted events, built sponsorship decks, run logistics for 1000+ people, and helped organize national startup summits. I enjoy learning how people think, what makes them tick, and how good design and tech can be a bridge between people and systems.

I’m an extrovert, but also someone who likes going deep — whether it’s a model architecture, a business deck, or an old-school martial arts kata. I learn best when I understand things thoroughly, and I ask a lot of “why’s” along the way.

☕ Interests Outside Tech
🍜 Food — big-time foodie, always up to explore new places or cook something wildly experimental.
📸 Photography — mostly candid, street, and the occasional cloud obsession.
🚴‍♂️ Cycling — long night rides are my version of therapy.
🥋 Martial Arts — trained in it, practiced it, loved it.
🚗 Cars — both on road and under the hood. If it moves, I’m curious.
🧠 My current mindset
I’m not chasing the fanciest solution — I want the right one. Whether that’s GANs or just clever thresholding in OpenCV, I enjoy going deep, failing a bit, iterating, and making something that works.

🔹 AI & Machine Learning Projects
1. Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, BeautifulSoup, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Word2Vec
Project Scope: 
Performed binary & ternary sentiment classification on Amazon Office Products reviews.
Preprocessed data: Lowercased text, removed HTML tags, URLs, punctuation, stop words, and applied lemmatization.
Word Embeddings: Used pre-trained Word2Vec (Google News) & custom Word2Vec.
Model Training & Evaluation (Scikit-learn & PyTorch): 
Binary Classification: SVM, Perceptron, MLP.
Ternary Classification: MLP (300D & reduced 10D embeddings).
Findings: 
Custom Word2Vec outperformed pre-trained embeddings in some cases.
Reducing word embeddings (300D → 10D) significantly reduced accuracy.
Best Model: Ternary MLP with custom 300D Word2Vec embeddings.

2. Multimodal Emotion Recognition Projects Summary
Technologies Used: PyTorch, MediaPipe, OpenCV, ResNet18, LSTM, CNN, Audio/Text/Visual Fusion
Projects Completed:
Facial Landmark Detection & Emotion Classification (FER2013):
Extracted key facial landmarks (eyes, mouth corners) using MediaPipe. Trained ResNet18 on grayscale images for both landmark regression (MSE Loss) and emotion classification (CrossEntropy Loss). Achieved ~65% accuracy with best performance on “Happy” and “Surprise” classes.
Multimodal Fusion Model (MELD-based):
Built a multimodal system integrating facial video (visual), speech tone (audio), and transcript (text) features using an early fusion approach. Each modality had its own feature extractor, and the combined features were fed into a unified classifier.
Conducted unimodal and fusion experiments, plotted confusion matrices, and found that early fusion improved accuracy on nuanced emotions compared to using single modalities alone.

🧠 Multimodal Emotion Recognition

This project came out of my curiosity about how machines can understand not just what people are saying, but also how they’re saying it — essentially, getting machines to pick up on emotion like humans do.

Using the MELD dataset, I built a multimodal emotion classifier that fuses three streams:

Visual input: I used MediaPipe to extract facial landmarks from each video frame and passed them through a ResNet-based encoder to capture micro-expressions.
Audio features: With Librosa, I extracted MFCCs, zero-crossing rates, and pitch contours to detect tone shifts and emotional vocal patterns.
Textual content: Processed transcripts using TF-IDF and Word2Vec embeddings to encode semantic meaning.
These streams were aligned frame-by-frame and fused using early fusion before passing them into a bi-directional LSTM, which captured temporal dependencies across the modalities. The final classification yielded ~74% accuracy, outperforming unimodal baselines significantly.

This wasn’t just a deep learning experiment — it was about bridging the gap between cold code and human feeling. It made me appreciate the nuances in multimodal fusion and the art of aligning signals that speak different languages.

3. Gallbladder Stone Detection using Ultrasound Images 🏥🔍
Problem Statement:
Ultrasound imaging is widely used for gallbladder stone detection, but manual diagnosis is prone to errors due to image noise, low contrast, and variability in stone shape/size.
The goal is to automate stone detection using computer vision and deep learning, making it a cost-effective alternative to MRI/CT scans.
Technical Approach:
✔ Gallbladder Identification & ROI Extraction:
U-Net segmentation was used to localize the gallbladder and extract the region of interest (ROI).
Contour detection & morphological operations further refined the extracted region.
✔ Deep Learning Model for Stone Detection:
CNN Architectures Used: 
VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2 for feature extraction.
Custom CNN with Second-Order Pooling for better texture-based feature learning.
Why Second-Order Pooling? 
It captures high-order relationships between pixel intensities, improving precision in irregular stone detection.
✔ Results & Impact:
Achieved 30% improvement in detection accuracy compared to standard ultrasound methods.
Proposed AI-driven detection model that significantly reduces misdiagnosis rates.
Demonstrated a 30% cost reduction by replacing expensive MRI/CT scans with AI-based ultrasound interpretation.

This project focused on improving the accuracy and accessibility of gallbladder stone detection using deep learning. Traditional ultrasound scans can be noisy, and diagnosis often varies by clinician. So I built a system that leverages VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2 with second-order pooling to identify stones with better feature learning.

I used region proposal networks (RPNs) to localize the gallbladder and extracted ROIs. Preprocessing steps involved CLAHE contrast enhancement, contour filtering, and OpenCV pipelines to refine image input.

Looking ahead, this system could be validated clinically and integrated into hospital diagnostic workflows.

4. Sign Language Recognition System 🤟📜

✔ Results & Impact:

6. YouTube Video Summarizer (LLM & Generative AI) 🎥📜
Problem Statement:
YouTube videos are often too long, making it difficult for users to extract key insights quickly.
The goal is to use Large Language Models (LLMs) & Generative AI to summarize videos concisely while retaining key information.
Technical Approach:
