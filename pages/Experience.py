Hereâ€™s a quick look at some of the roles where Iâ€™ve applied my skills in real-world settings â€” from AI in agriculture and education to running events with thousands of people.

Every experience taught me something different: how to solve problems, how to work with people, and how to keep learning on the job.

At ResoluteAI, I worked on AI-powered drone vision systems for agriculture and infrastructure.

- Designed custom **YOLOv8-based pipelines** to detect defective infrastructure and irrigation leaks in aerial footage
- Built a **sapling counter** for agriculture clients using OpenCV + YOLO â€” achieved over 95% accuracy
- Developed a Streamlit dashboard to visualize inference results for client-facing demo day

This internship gave me a real appreciation for performance-vs-accuracy tradeoffs, edge deployment challenges, and what it means to build something useful in the wild.

At Suvidha Foundation, I contributed to an edtech outreach initiative focused on improving access to quality education for rural girls.

- Preprocessed **mobile-scanned textbook images** using OpenCV: adaptive thresholding, denoising, and morphological cleaning
- Improved readability and contrast of low-resolution learning material distributed to over 100 students
- Supported outreach and crowdfunding campaigns for distributing tech-driven learning kits

This was a reminder that even simple models and classic computer vision can have real impact.

At BloomBox, I wasnâ€™t just organizing events â€” I was helping run a full-fledged student startup incubator.

- Led sponsorship outreach and closed deals that funded **70% of our flagship summit**
- Managed end-to-end execution for **a 1000+ attendee event** with **Ashneer Grover** as the keynote speaker
- Built all pitch decks, emails, and handled content + marketing strategy

This taught me how to write, how to pitch, and how to make things happen even with messy resources and tighter timelines.
