Hi, I'm **Khushal Jhaveri** — currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence at the **University of Southern California (USC)**.

I like building systems that live at the intersection of **AI, vision, and language** — things that make machines understand humans a little better, and maybe even help out in the real world.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on everything from **multimodal emotion recognition** using video, audio, and text, to building drone vision systems for agriculture, to improving textbook readability for underprivileged girls with nothing but OpenCV and a purpose.

I'm also a certified **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals** cloud developer, and enjoy taking ideas all the way from a prototype to something that runs reliably.

### 💬 Outside the Resume

I’m not just about code and models — I love putting myself out there.

I’ve hosted events, built sponsorship decks, run logistics for 1000+ people, and helped organize national startup summits. I enjoy learning how people think, what makes them tick, and how good design and tech can be a bridge between people and systems.

I’m an **extrovert**, but also someone who **likes going deep** — whether it’s a model architecture, a business deck, or an old-school martial arts kata. I learn best when I understand things thoroughly, and I ask a lot of “why’s” along the way.

### ☕ Things I Love Outside Tech

- 🍜 **Food** — big-time foodie, always up to explore new places or cook something wildly experimental.
- 📸 **Photography** — mostly candid, street, and the occasional cloud obsession.
- 🚴‍♂️ **Cycling** — long night rides are my version of therapy.
- 🥋 **Martial Arts** — trained in it, practiced it, loved it.
- 🚗 **Cars** — both on road and under the hood. If it moves, I’m curious.
