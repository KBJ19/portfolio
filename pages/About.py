st.write("""
Hi, I'm **Khushal Jhaveri** — currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence at the **University of Southern California (USC)**.

I like building systems that sit at the intersection of **AI, vision, and language** — things that make machines understand humans a little better, and maybe even help out in the real world.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on everything from **multimodal emotion recognition** using video, audio, and text, to building **drone vision systems** for agriculture, to improving **textbook readability for underprivileged girls** with nothing but OpenCV and a purpose.

Before USC, I completed my B.Tech in Computer Engineering from **K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering**, Mumbai, with an Honors in Cybersecurity. I was also the **Marketing Head of BloomBox**, our entrepreneurship cell, where I led large-scale events, fundraising, and community engagement — including organizing a 1000+ attendee event with Ashneer Grover as keynote speaker.

Professionally, I’ve interned as a **Deep Learning Engineer at ResoluteAI**, leading proof-of-concept projects involving drone imaging, YOLOv8 models, and traditional CV pipelines. I also worked at **Suvidha Foundation**, enhancing educational material scans for underprivileged communities using OpenCV and morphological operations.

### 💬 Outside the Resume

I’m not just about code and models — I thrive in chaos too.

I’ve hosted events, built sponsorship decks, run logistics for national startup summits, and volunteered as a speaker coordinator. These experiences shaped how I think about leadership, storytelling, and problem-solving.

I’m an **extrovert**, but one who **dives deep** — into architecture design, business decks, or old-school martial arts katas. I learn best when I explore things thoroughly, and I ask a lot of “why’s” along the way.

### 🌱 Things I'm Exploring

- Using AI for **education and accessibility**
- Building **low-cost healthcare tools** via computer vision
- LLMs for **summarization, creativity, and context-aware assistants**
- Cloud systems that scale smart — I’m also **Azure certified**

### ☕ Things I Love Outside Tech

- 🍜 **Food** — Big-time foodie. I love discovering new places, trying new cuisines, and cooking wildly experimental things at home.
- 📸 **Photography** — Mostly candid, street, and the occasional perfectly timed sunset or cloud obsession.
- 🚴‍♂️ **Cycling** — Long night rides are my version of therapy and brainstorming.
- 🥋 **Martial Arts** — Trained, practiced, and still humbled by it.
- 🚗 **Cars** — Both under the hood and on the track. If it moves, I’m curious.

### 🧠 My Current Mindset

I’m not chasing the fanciest solution — I want the **right** one. Whether that’s GANs or just clever thresholding in OpenCV, I enjoy going deep, failing fast, iterating, and making something that actually works.

And if I can help someone else along the way — whether it’s through mentoring, collaboration, or just sharing what I’ve learned — I’m all in for it.

Thanks for dropping by :)
