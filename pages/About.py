Hi, I'm **Khushal Jhaveri** — currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence at the **University of Southern California (USC)**.

I love building systems that sit at the intersection of **AI, vision, and language**, especially when they solve real-world problems — the kind where datasets are messy, edge cases are the norm, and impact matters more than benchmarks.

Over the past few years, I've worked on projects that go well beyond accuracy scores. Whether it was building a **multimodal emotion detector** using video, audio, and text, or improving **textbook readability for underprivileged kids** using nothing but OpenCV — the goal has always been to make tech more **grounded, useful, and human**.

Before USC, I did my B.Tech in Computer Engineering at **K.J. Somaiya College in Mumbai**, with an Honors in Cybersecurity. Alongside academics, I led as **Marketing Head at BloomBox**, our entrepreneurship cell — where I pitched, fundraised, hosted, and pulled off events with 1000+ people and keynote speakers like Ashneer Grover. Learned more about teamwork and real-world leadership there than from any classroom.

Professionally, I’ve worked as a **Deep Learning Engineer Intern at ResoluteAI**, building drone imaging solutions and YOLOv8-based detection pipelines for agriculture and infrastructure. At **Suvidha Foundation**, I worked on enhancing low-quality book scans to help improve access to education for rural girls — small project, big impact.

### 💬 Outside the Resume

I’m not just about code and models — I thrive in chaos too.

I’ve run national startup events, built sponsorship decks from scratch, and volunteered as speaker coordinator and emcee. I’m an **extrovert**, but one who **dives deep** — into neural nets, business strategy, or even martial arts. I learn best when I get to explore the "why" behind things.

### ☕ Things I Love Outside Tech

- 🍜 **Food** — Big-time foodie. Catch me chasing street food in Mumbai or slow-roasting something random at 2am.
- 📸 **Photography** — Mostly candid, raw, and in-the-moment. I like capturing people in their realest moods.
- 🚴‍♂️ **Cycling** — Long solo rides at night are my therapy.
- 🥋 **Martial Arts** — Trained and practiced. Nothing humbles you like a good kata.
- 🚗 **Cars** — Road, engine, design — if it moves, I’m curious.

### 🌱 Currently Exploring

- AI for **education** and **healthcare accessibility**
- Emotion & sentiment systems for **context-aware assistants**
- LLMs for **summarization and creativity**
- Cloud systems that scale smart — I’m also **Azure Certified** (Microsoft Learn)

---

### 🧠 My Mindset

I don’t chase the fanciest model — I chase the one that **works**. If clever thresholding in OpenCV solves the problem better than deep learning, so be it. I love prototyping fast, failing smart, and getting things into the wild.

And if I can help someone else build better — whether through open-source, mentoring, or just vibing over shared ideas — I’m all in.

Thanks for dropping by :)
